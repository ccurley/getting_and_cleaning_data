# Getting and Cleaning Data

Repo containing R scripts and notes for the Getting and Cleaning Data sets course.

This is a public repo, but I strongly caution cribbers to NOT use anything you find in the repo as a basis for submitting assignments. I'm rubbish at using R -- which I seem to think is PERL.

It's better to think, "huh, if he did it this way, and I'm doing it the same way, then I must be doing it wrong."

You've been warned.
